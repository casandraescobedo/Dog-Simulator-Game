About The Game
Welcome to Dog Life Simulator! In this game, every choice you make has a consequence. You begin as a puppy with a critical decision: stay with your mother or get adopted by a human. From there, a series of scenarios will test your instincts and your luck.

Will you be a loyal companion or a wild wanderer? Will you survive encounters with dangerous animals and poisonous plants? Your final score is the number of months you managed to live.

Key Features:

Dynamic Story: Follow one of two major story branches with multiple endings.

Choice-Based Gameplay: Your decisions directly impact whether you live happily or meet an untimely end.

Life Tracker: The game counts how many months you survive.

Replayable: A simple loop allows you to play again instantly to try a different path.
